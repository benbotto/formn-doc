# Getting Started

This documentation is intented to be read like a book, from beginning to end.
It goes through the process of setting up a TypeScript project, installing
dependencies, and creating an example database using migrations.  It then goes
over the basics of Formn, CRUD operations, and validation.  Each section is
loaded with example code, and that code is available in the
[formn-example](https://github.com/benbotto/formn-example).  If you want to follow along with the tutorial, grab the examples.

```
git clone https://github.com/benbotto/formn-example.git
cd formn-example
npm install
```
