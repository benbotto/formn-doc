# Updating

In this part of the documentation we'll cover updating records.  You should be
familiar with the basics introduced in the [Getting
Started](../getting-started/), [DataContext](../datacontext/), and
[Models](../models/) sections.  There's also some overlap with the
[Retrieving](../retrieving/) section.
